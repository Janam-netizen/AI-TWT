# Intro to linear regression

In this tutorial we will get an insight 

into how linear regression works and work 

see how we can apply it.  We will be using 

libraries in python to deploy linear 

regression algorithim.  

# Theory

Many data sets have an approximately linear relationship between variables. In these cases, we can predict one variable using a known value for another using a best-fit line, a line of the form

y = mx+b


that follows the trends in the data as closely as possible.
